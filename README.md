This project demonstrates a gesture-controlled robot car using Raspberry Pi, MediaPipe, OpenCV, Bluetooth (HC-05), and Arduino Uno. 

A webcam connected to the Raspberry Pi captures real-time hand gestures, which are processed using MediaPipe and OpenCV. Recognized gestures (like an open palm, fist, or directional fingers) are mapped to motion commandsâ€”such as forward, backward, left, right, and stop.
The Raspberry Pi sends these commands wirelessly via Bluetooth to the Arduino Uno, which drives the robot car using an L298N motor driver and DC motors. This setup enables wireless, intuitive control of a robot car without additional remotes or RF modules.
Raspberry is used in it to run the Python program that captures webcam input, detects hand gestures using MediaPipe and OpenCV, and sends control commands to the Arduino over Bluetooth.
Hc-05 module is used to enable wireless communication between Raspberry Pi and Arduino.
